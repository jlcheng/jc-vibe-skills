# Experiments

This is the record for skills in `jc-vibe`. 
For each skill, record:

- What it does and where it came from.
- What commands it runs and what it sends over the network.
- What has and has not been tested.
- Known limitations, failure modes, and the date it was last checked.
- Whether it is ready to promote to `jc-agent-skills`.

## wrangler

- **What it does:** Guides John through his skill workflow: which of his three places a skill
  belongs in (vibe, published, someone else's repo), and the `jc-plugin` commands to install,
  update, remove, and list plugins in Claude Code and Codex. Written by John and Claude on
  2026-09-26.
- **Invocation:** By name only (`/jc-vibe:wrangler`, `$jc-vibe:wrangler`); neither tool starts it on its own.
- **Commands and network:** The skill itself runs nothing. It suggests `jc-plugin`, `claude plugin`,
  `git` commands, which fetch from GitHub when run.
- **Tested:** Installed through `jc-plugin` into both tools; a fresh session in each loaded it
  (2026-09-26).
- **Not tested:** Whether its advice holds up across a real promotion from vibe to published.
- **Limitations:** Describes `jc-plugin` as of 2026-09-26, which can't install Claude-only repos.
  Local testing before pushing is not covered yet.
- **Ready to promote:** No.
